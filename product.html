                <h2>Red Delicious</h2>
                <p>The Red Delicious apple is a well-known variety with a striking red exterior and a sweet taste. Discovered in Madison County, Iowa, in 1872, it was originally named “Hawkeye” before being renamed “Red Delicious” by Stark Nurseries. These apples are medium-sized with a tall, conical shape and a bright red color. They are juicy and slightly crisp, with a mild flavor that some people find bland compared to other varieties like Gala or Fuji. Red Delicious was the most produced apple variety in the United States from 1968 to 2018, but its popularity has declined due to the rise of other apple varieties and changes in consumer preferences. Despite this, the Red Delicious apple remains an iconic variety, especially in North America, thanks to its thick skin that helps resist bruising and allows for good storage.</p>

                <h2>Granny Smith</h2>
                <p>The Granny Smith apple is a popular tart variety known for its bright green skin and distinct sour taste. It originated in Australia in 1868, discovered by Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. These apples are round and slightly flattened, with a crisp, juicy texture and a tart, acidic flavor that makes them ideal for both fresh eating and baking. Granny Smith apples are particularly valued for their ability to retain their shape when cooked, making them a favorite for pies and other baked goods. They are also low in calories, high in fiber, and contain beneficial antioxidants. Today, Granny Smith apples are grown worldwide and remain a staple in many kitchens.</p>

                <h2>Golden Delicious</h2>
                <p>The Golden Delicious apple is a widely cherished variety known for its sweet, crisp flavor and vibrant yellow skin. Discovered by chance in 1912 on the Mullins farm in Clay County, West Virginia, it was initially called “Mullin’s Yellow Seedling” before being renamed “Golden Delicious” by Stark Bro’s Nurseries in 1914. This apple is medium to large in size, with a smooth, thin skin that can sometimes exhibit russeting, particularly around the stem. Its sweet taste and firm texture make it ideal for both fresh eating and baking. Golden Delicious apples are also a key parent variety for many modern cultivars, including Gala, Jonagold, and Fuji. Despite being prone to bruising and shriveling, they remain one of the most popular apple varieties in the United States and are celebrated for their versatility and delightful flavor.</p>

                <h2>Fuji</h2>
                <p>The Fuji apple is a sweet and crisp variety that was developed in Japan in the late 1930s by cross-pollinating the Red Delicious and Ralls Janet apple varieties. Named after the town of Fujisaki where it was created, the Fuji apple is known for its large size, dense flesh, and high sugar content, which makes it one of the sweetest apple varieties available. Its skin is typically red with yellow undertones, and it has a long shelf life, even without refrigeration. Fuji apples are popular worldwide, especially in Japan, China, and the United States, where they are enjoyed both fresh and in various culinary applications. Their firm texture and juicy, sweet flavor make them a favorite for snacking, baking, and salads.</p>
